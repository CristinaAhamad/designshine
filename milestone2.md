## Idea Explanation
  In Milestone 1, we focused primarily on giving users information about the weather and wave conditions at beaches in California and indicating whether those conditions are good or bad for surfing. Since Milestone 1, we have added a review feature that gives users more information about the beach they want to visit, so they get more than just information about the weather and waves. Users can write about their surfing experiences there and read about what other surfers have to say about the same beach. They can also rate the waves there and recommend whether that beach is typically best for beginner, intermediate, or expert surfers. Based on these reviews and recommendations, users will know if that beach is worth going to or if they should look for another beach on the app that is more suitable for their level of surfing.

## Screenshots versus Prototypes
Our home page still displays a map of the local coastline as it did in the paper prototype, but we added a list of the beaches within that area underneath the map. Users can select one of the beaches from this list to view information about the weather and reviews. We added this to make it clearer that the purpose of the app is to find out more about the weather and beaches, not just to find where the beaches are. The page that displays all the information about the beach is similar to the paper prototype in the way that it lists all the weather and indicates the current surf conditions. However, in the screenshotted page, we added overall beach and wave ratings at the top and links to read and post reviews at the bottom. Our search page and profile page are the same in the screenshots as they are in the paper prototypes. Finally, we added two pages, one for reading reviews and one for posting reviews about specific beaches, that we did not include in our paper prototypes, since the review feature was added after Milestone 1.
