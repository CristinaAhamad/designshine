## Improvements
The login page now has a photo of a surfer on the left, with the login and create new account fields on the right. The background is now a light, muted blue instead of white to give users less strain on the eyes. The fields are now also on different lines, making it easier to notice specific fields.

On the home page, the map was extended to fit the width of the screen so that it is easier to spot locations.

Individual weather pages for each beach now lists the wave conditions of the specific beach, and has the review section below it. On the write review page, the text field is now wider so users can see what they are typing. Reviews about each beach are italicized, so users can easily know what is a review from other users.

The search page now contains two columns: on the left is the map of La Jolla, and on the right is the list of the beaches near you. When a user searches, the right side of the page is updated; beforehand, since there was no map, this occurred in the center of the page. The font was also changed and enlarged so it is easier to read. 

All the pages have a footer menu with a darker color to stand out. Beforehand, the footer was just below the content of the page, and had no background color. Now, it is fixed at the bottom of the page, regardless of scrolling, so that users can easily navigate through the application without constantly having to scroll to the bottom of each page. The background color and font were also updated on every page for consistency.
