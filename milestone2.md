## Idea Explanation
  In Milestone 1, we focused primarily on giving users information about the weather and wave conditions at beaches in California and indicating whether those conditions are good or bad for surfing. Since Milestone 1, we have added a review feature that gives users more information about the beach they want to visit, so they get more than just information about the weather and waves. Users can write about their surfing experiences there and read about what other surfers have to say about the same beach. They can also rate the waves there and recommend whether that beach is typically best for beginner, intermediate, or expert surfers. Based on these reviews and recommendations, users will know if that beach is worth going to or if they should look for another beach on the app that is more suitable for their level of surfing.
