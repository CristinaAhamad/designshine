Idea #1: Surfing Conditions
	Our app’s target population is surfers in California. None of our team members are in the target population since none of us surf. The app can be used to track the current wave conditions at beaches along the California coastline. It tells users whether or not these conditions, such as wave height, tides, and wind, are ideal for surfing. Possible sources of real-world data and APIs are the open weather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) for the current weather conditions and the weather and ocean API (https://magicseaweed.com/developer/forecast-api) for more specific information about the surf.
	
Idea #2: Book Club & Recommendations
Another possible app idea we have is a book recommendation app. This app would target users who can’t easily find people who have similar tastes in literature or who can’t find people who also like to read. None of our team members are in this target population since we aren’t looking for book recommendations. Based on their favorite genres and previously read books, they can get recommendations of books they might like. They can also connect with other users who read the same book. For this app idea we would use the Google Books API (https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview) to gather information about the books. We are unsure if we should pursue this idea since having a discussion forum or chats with other users about the books can potentially fall under the ‘taboo topics’. 


Storyboard for Idea #1
Person lives far away from the beach, wants to see if its a good time to surf
Surfer is at a beach where the waves are bad so they go on their app to see if a nearby beach is better
