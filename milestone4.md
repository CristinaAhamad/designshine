## Explanation
The homepage has now adopted the layout that was previously on the search page, and the search page has been eliminated. Now, the user can search on the homepage and have information about weather conditions appear when a beach is clicked, without refreshing. The combining of the UI of the home and search pages makes the application more usable because the user does not have to navigate through multiple pages for similar functions. Additionally, the right hand side of the home page scrolls individually; the whole page does not scroll when the list of beaches is longer than the height of the web page. In this way, the user can easily look to the left and find the beach on the map, instead of having to scroll from the name of the beach to the map.

The search page now integrates reviews submitted by users as well as Google reviews. Before, the reviews were merely indicated by italicized words; now, reviews are partitioned by horizontal lines so it is easier for readers of the reviews to skim.  

## User Actions
### User Action 1: Get weather conditions
You want to check the surf at Pacific Beach. From the home page, you can either type it into the search bar at the top, scroll through the list to find it, or find it on the map . Click on the link below to view the conditions in a new page.

### User Action 2: Reviews
You want to post a review for a beach you recently visited, Scripps Pier. Navigate to the Scripps Pier weather details page by searching for it and clicking to view details.  Click “post a review” at the bottom of  the page and add whatever review you want, then find your review on the beach’s main review page.
